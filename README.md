## STELLE

A forma mais segura de fechar contratos de trabalho freelancer.

With the increasing rate of freelance workers, how can we demonstrate the importance of using Blockchain technology to close freelance work contracts online? Today there is a growing number of freelancers. According to reports from specialized labor market institutions such as the Bureau of Labor Statistics since 2010, the number of freelancers has grown by approximately 50%, reaching about 60 million workers in the United States alone. According to research conducted by renowned consulting firms such as McKinsey & Company, Deloitte, and PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC), the freelance industry generates over $1.5 trillion globally annually, demonstrating steady and substantial growth. Statistics and trends about the freelance job market show that about 70% of global companies already use freelancers in some form in their workforce. However, it is important to understand that despite the growth, security is needed. Immutability, Transparency, and Traceability are necessary for the prevention of fraud and/or contract alterations, as a survey conducted by the Freelancers Union and Upwork in 2019 found that 64% of freelancers reported being victims of non-payment for work performed. According to the 2020 Global Fraud and Identity Report from Experian, 56% of organizations have seen an increase in fraud over the past 12 months. It is interesting to look at the Reduction of Intermediaries and Costs because today it is estimated that traditional financial intermediaries, such as banks, charge fees ranging from 1% to 5% on international transactions, which can represent a significant portion of the freelancer's payment. In addition, a McKinsey & Company survey estimated that replacing intermediaries with digital technologies could reduce costs by up to 20%. Finally, the lack of a truly secure environment poses a Risk of Payment and Contract Compliance. According to a study by Fundbox, approximately 64% of freelancers have experienced payment delays at some point in their careers. Additionally, McKinsey & Company's Global Payments 2020 survey found that the lack of digital payment infrastructure could cost the global economy up to 3.7% of annual GDP. Seeking to mitigate and address these issues, Stelle was born, which executes smart contracts for freelance work contracts using blockchain technology to provide security, transparency, and efficiency to contracts, ensuring immutability, traceability, and cost reduction by eliminating traditional intermediaries.

## SCROLL: 

The Scroll provides a responsive solution capable enough for logical processing and rules applied in a work demand. The established smart contract must be able to express the responsibilities of the parties between a client with a demand and a freelance developer, ensuring security for transactions between wallets, deadlines, descriptions, etc. The MVP contract expresses the functionality of completing a task within the deadline, allowing the freelancer to indicate that the transaction can already be made. Considering that Stelle offers a labor marketplace service for software development to clients and their projects, several offers are constantly requested from the smart contract. Scroll can maintain the service scalable, ensuring decentralized negotiation for clients.
Destaca-se o fato que essa solução foi viável por conta da excelente documentação da **** que facilitou o desenvolvimento de tal coisa, além da inspiração de outra solução que utilizou o Metamask Snap, o Snapshot Snap, que foi divulgado no site da Metamask.
